LEDWall
=======

Arduino sketches for LED Wall.

NOTE: To run these sketches, you will likely need to use the Adafruit_WS2801 library, using

#include "Adafruit_WS2801.h"

at the top of the sketch. To avoid keeping those files in the same folder as the sketch for every sketch, move the "Adafruit_WS2801.h" and "Adafruit_WS2801.cpp" files to "~/Arduino/libraries/Adafruit_WS2801/", with ~ referring to the directory where the Arduino IDE was installed.
